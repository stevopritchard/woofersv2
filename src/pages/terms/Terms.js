              <h2>WOOFERS APPOINTMENTS AND POLICIES</h2>
              <br />
              <h3>Cancellation/ No Shows/ Late Appointments</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As a small business, no-shows can have a detrimental effect on
                  us. Whilst we understand that sometimes appointments have to
                  be cancelled in an emergency, we do ask that you give us at
                  least 24 hours notice where possible, prior to appointment
                  cancellation, as we have a waiting list of clients. We reserve
                  the right to charge a fee of £15 for appointments missed or
                  cancelled with less than 24 hours notice payable prior to any
                  future booking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Arriving 30 minutes or more late for appointments will in most
                  cases require re-scheduling and a missed appointment fee of
                  £15 will apply.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Appointment times</h3>
              <p>
                We kindly request that you arrive at the time of your
                appointment and pick your pet up in reasonable time as advised.
                Once 30 minutes has elapsed after the arranged collection time a
                £10 charge per hour will be added to the final price unless
                previously arranged. This is to discourage pets being left with
                us for extended periods.
              </p>

              <h3>Dematting Policy</h3>
              <p>
                Minor matt removal is part of the normal grooming service
                provided but it takes a great deal of care and practice to
                undertake. As part of the general grooming services provided at
                Woofers each dog will be assessed on an individual basis and if
                after careful consideration for your pets welfare a clip off is
                the best course of action and can be achieved in the salon
                environment we will discuss the procedure and cost. If we feel
                that we can de-matt some or all of your dogs coat then an
                additional sum of £10.00 per 15 minutes will be incurred, in
                addition to the service all provided. We will only attempt to
                de-matt your dog if they are NOT showing signs of stress or
                anxiety To demonstrate good practice and as members of the
                Pet Industry Federation and British Dog Grooming Association we
                abide by sector specific charters including the Animal Welfare
                Act (2006). WE WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOUR DOG AT
                WOOFERS AND IF A CLIP OFF IS THE KINDEST COURSE OF ACTION, THIS
                WILL BE ADVISED.
              </p>
              <h3>Anal Glands</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Woofers does not offer any anal gland emptying as this
                  procedure is recommended to be carried out by a veterinary
                  surgeon. (This is confirmed in law by the veterinary surgeons
                  act 1966)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Refusal of service and aggressive dogs</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Woofers staff have the right to work in a safe environment and
                  therefore Woofers reserves the right to refuse any groom or
                  treatment, at any time. If any member of it staff feels they
                  are unable to carry out or continue a groom or treatment then
                  same will stop immediately, and you as the owner will be
                  responsible for payment of the work carried out up until this
                  point.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your dog is showing signs of aggression and or biting but
                  the groomer feels they can continue, then an appropriate
                  muzzle may be used during any groom or treatment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your dog has behaviour problems, please let Woofers know
                  when the appointment is made. Please also ensure that the
                  member of staff to whom you give the dog is informed as to
                  whether your dog has ever bitten another human or dog or has
                  shown any signs of aggression in the past.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Additional charges may apply for extra time required due to a
                  dog’s temperament and or behaviour during a groom or
                  treatment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You, as the owner agree to be held solely liable for any harm,
                  injury or damaged caused by your dog and any costs thereafter
                  incurred.
                </li>
